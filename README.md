# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that allows two players to compete in a battle of wits and strategy. In this project, we've implemented the game in two different versions - v-vanillajs and v-typescript.

The v-vanillajs version of the game is written in pure JavaScript, with no additional frameworks or libraries. It's a great example of how to build a simple, yet engaging game using vanilla JavaScript.

The v-typescript version, on the other hand, is built using TypeScript - a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that provides additional safety and tooling to your code. This version of the game demonstrates how to use TypeScript to build a robust and scalable web application.
